# Building-an-API-with-Flask

To get a better understanding of APIs, this project is built to perform a general approach with FLASK, which is considered a great moment to link with future machine learning projects and the idea to integrate later Scikit-learn, Tensorflow and so on.

In machine learning engineering, this is part of the deployment process and the primary step to think in a product sense. I have not yet discarded to use some of the other projects, but it is an excellent starting to get out of Jupyter Notebooks.
